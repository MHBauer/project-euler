Gonna do project Euler solutions in here.

Check my [Project Euler Progress](https://projecteuler.net/profile/mohaba.png)!

My grand plan is to have each different implementation cross-check
against all of the others.

Starting with a blast from the past, last edited 2011,
during graduate school at UF in Gainesville, Florida.

These solutions were worked together with Hayward Cooper.
We usually gathered at his place, and sent them back and forth over email,
and eventually I put it in dropbox to share with others.

It was interactively developed in IDLE,
and reloaded after changes to run each solution.
It appears that even at this point we were using python3,
as we are using print as a function `print()`.

At an IDLE3 prompt, import the file as a Module and run one of the functions in the Module.
``` python3
>>> import MorganEuler

>>> MorganEuler.euler001()
    233168
```

Example oneshotY
``` console
$  python3 -c 'import MorganEuler; MorganEuler.euler001()'
233168
```

My only previous use of python was with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

The ask of the project is not to publish solutions past the first 100.
If I publish anything, it will be in encrypted form, as I do want to have my solutions in source control.
